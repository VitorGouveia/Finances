# Value Investing
Value investing is a technique used by the majority (if not all) famous investors. It allows them to buy great companies at discounted prices.

This is important because buying companies at discounted may the game-changing factor for you and many other people. If theses companies are really worth more than they're being sold for, then you could buy into them and hold profits for many and many years.

And if theses companies pay dividends, you could theorically have dividend yields over 100%, as explained [here](../dividend-vs-non-dividend/readme.md)

For this strategy to work we need to know first what makes companies great, what about theses companies that bring such value into people's lives. After that, we could work our way through finding out if the company is cheap or not, and finally making it a script, so we can always search the market for great companies at discounted prices.
