# Risk Management
Risk management is an essential part of your portifolio, it can literally save or break your finances.

Have you ever split your money on stocks equally?

Have you ever lowered your DAC (Dollar Cost Average) after stock prices plumetted?

If you have done any of the above, I'm sorry to inform you that you're nothing short of a dumb idiot.

## The 'default' diversification
The 'default' way people do asset diversification is to just split your money across multiple stocks and that's it, no risk analysis, no risk score, nothing.

When you diversify your portifolio this way you're basically saying:

"I trust The Bank of America (billions of dollars in assets) and this bank my friend opened last week (negative sucirities and asssets) the same"

And when you do this, sh*t happens.

You can have that one risky stock to drop 50%, 60% or even 90% and put all your money on the line just because you didn't want to research a litte more.

## The correct way
When choosing assets and stocks for you investing portifolio you should *always* thing in a scale of 1 to 10 on how dangerous it can be to invest in that asset/stock. You should *never* just equally diversify your position against your stocks.

### Example

**Wrong way of diversifying:**

- (33%) Low Risk Stock
- (33%) Medium Risk Stock
- (33%) High Risk Stock

When diversifying like this you're exposing too much of your money to a risk asset and too little to a low risk one.

**Correct way:**

- (70%) Low Risk Stock
- (20%) Medium Risk Stock
- (10%) High Risk Stock

When diversifying the correct way you're much more exposed to secure, high-quality and low risk stocks and just a little bit exposed to high-risk stocks.


DAC is bullshit
you should always buy stocks based on how safe it is
you should also diversify against different classes
